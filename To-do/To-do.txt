1. Analyze the test set to get frequencies of substrings (by kmers). Try to cluster the patterns, or make other use of such information.
2. Obtain confidence at the pattern/substring-level. Pick sample sequences containing such patterns (making the most mistakes) and partially label them (i.e. only label the patterns). Pseudo-label the unlabeled part and train the CRF model.
3. It is important to know how to deal with the new introduced errors (because we have pseudo labels).
4. Formalize query strategies, not only intuitives.

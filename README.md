# CRF_Building
#### This goal of this project is to use active learning to label point names (e.g. sensor and attribute names) in smart buildings. While we want to achieve high accuracy by sequential labeling using conditional random field, we also want to minimize the efforts of human labeling. The baseline implementation considers active learning at point name level (i.e. for each manual labeling, a whole point name will be labeled). Our main contribution focuses on pattern-level labeling, that is, when performing active learning, we only label a part of a point name that the machine/computer needs to learn.
